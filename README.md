# Your-Favorite-Process
A website built for the 'Your Favorite T-shirts' company that provides automation of data entry.   

Process: takes a CSV file (uploaded) with a list of orders (buyer information and items purchased), processes it, and outputs a ready-to-use, formatted CSV file by the manufacturer's specification.

Deals with older listings of the company, where data is not stored in a uniform manner, so there is a need to tackle individual cases. 

PHP, HTML, Bootstrap
